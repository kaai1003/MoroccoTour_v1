# MoroccoTour
## Discover The Best Places to Visit in Moccoor


### Team Members :

Name : Kacem Aimad
Role : Full Stack Development , Including Front-end, Back-end, Database, API and QA/Testing
Role Allocation Decision : I decided to be the sole developer of this project in order to handle all aspects of web development from Back-end to Front-end including Database Management , API, Quality assurance and Testing which will help me to improve my skills in Full Stack Development.

### Technologies : 

####  Languages and Libraries: Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
####  Platforms : 
Visual Studio Code : Project Development environment .
Git : Project Version Control.
GitHub : Project Code Repository.
Mysql: Project Database Management.
#### Frameworks : 
Flask : Back-end Development.
jQuery : project JavaScript Interactions.
SQLAlchemy : ORM Database Management.
Jinja2 : Flask Templates development.
#### Hardware : 
Personal Computer : for Project development Work including virtual servers for testing before hosting service.
Books and Resources : Coding languages and libraries Documentations and Tutorials , Morocco Tourism Books.
Alternative Technology options : 
Django : another popular web framework that comes with a lot of built-in features that can speed up development .
Flask vs Django Use :  Flask was chosen because of its lightweightness and flexibility that allow more control over components especially for smaller projects like our case , on the other hand the Django Technology can be overkill for smaller projects and less flexible over customization.
Vanilla JS : another Script Development that can be used on web projects for its fast execution and more efficient over performance-critical projects.
jQuery vs Vanilla JS : I choose jQuery on this project because of its simplicity with rich library and predefined functions , on other hand the Vanilla JS is more complex to write code and it's not compatible with all browsers .

### Challenge : 

Problem to Solve : Help Tourists visiting Morocco that face challenges finding reliable and comprehensive information about best places to visit , by providing necessary information in order to plan their trips efficiently based on tourists Reviews and feedback that had already visited Morocco .
Problem will not solve :  web application project will not cover the real-time bookings for hotels and restaurants and Language translation service .
Target Users : Local and international tourists that plan to visit Morocco .
Local Relevance : this project is specially relevant to Morocco.

### Risks :
Technical Risk :  Working alone is the primary risk on this project, where planning and time management are the keys to avoid overload work and ensure Well-development of all web application parts.
Non-Technical Risks : Application may have a weak audience traffic , that will result in low user engagement and project failure . In order to avoid this scenario we should increase the visibility of the web application and attract users by marketing the app on different social media and through different tourism collaborations.

### Infrastructure :
Branching and Merging : While I will work alone in this project, Trunk-based development will be my branching strategy for its low complexity . And for merging, I will simply review my code manually and merge with the master branch. 
Deployment : Before deploying the application on the production environment , a test staging will be used in order to catch any deployment issues and bugs.
Data Population : The application will be populated with initial basic data with the best visited places and moving towards  users reviews and rating .
Testing : using unit tests is mandatory in order to ensure well-developed components in addition a manual testing will be used .
Existing Solutions :
Similar solutions : Internationally there are plenty Well known similar ideas that cover tourism worldwide like TripAdvisor and Foursquare but they are oriented to services marketing , and Locally we can find the Visitmorocco website that provides valuable information for international tourists.
 Reimplementation : while there are already internationally proven solutions that cover Morocco tourism , MoroccoTour will focus on the Moroccan Tourism market in order encourage tourists to Visit the beautiful places in morocco based on user previous visits especially that morocco will organize football world cup in 2030.
